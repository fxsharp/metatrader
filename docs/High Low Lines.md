# High Low Lines

<img src="images/High Low Lines.png" title="High Low Lines">

This MetaTrader 4 custom indicator shows
daily, weekly, and monthly high and low prices.

Red lines show the highest prices
for the day and for the week,
while green lines show the lowest prices.

In order to see
yesterday's high/low and last week's high/low,
each line lasts two periods;
two days for the day's high/low,
two weeks for the week's high/low,
and two months for the month's high/low.
